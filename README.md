# Functions in SQL

## Introduction

  Functions give the ability to leverage complex code in statements. 
The system has pre-defined Functions and give you the ability to 
define new, custom functions. Properly using the various type of 
functions allows for clear, concise code.
  
## Application of UDF

  A User Defined Function is used when you want to reuse the logic 
that you create. Creating complex code that can be stored in the 
server and then referenced at will is the power of the UDF.
  
## Scaler, Inline and Multi-Statement Functions	

  A Scaler UDF returns a value, it can be with or without parameters. 
An Inline UDF returns a single table from a select statement. A 
Multi-Statement UDF is defined table return that can contain 
multiple select statements. An Inline UDF has better performance 
than a Multi-Statement and should be used if possible.
  
## Summary

  Functions are important for clear, concise code. Leveraging the 
functions in SQL and defining user functions allows for greater 
flexibility in organizing the available data.
